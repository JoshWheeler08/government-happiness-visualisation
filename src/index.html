        <h4>Government Effectiveness & Happiness Data Visualization</h4>
        <p><em>An interactive exploration of the relationship between public perception of government and personal happiness</em></p>

        <p>
          In this practical, we wanted to investigate how the public's perception of its government can impact their personal 
          happiness and to explore whether these results differ over geographical regions. To do this, we have combined the World Happiness Report* 
          - a dataset which measures the estimated happiness of a population using data attributes such as 'Log GDP', 
          'Freedom to make choices' and 'Health life expectancy' - with the World Governance Indicators dataset*. 
          The WGI project reports aggregate and individual governance indicators for over 200 countries, 
          which can be used to summarise the quality of a government. Similar to the Happiness report, 
          it has multiple dimensions for measuring the quality of governance of a government,
           which includes 'Control of Corruption', 'Political Stability and Absense of violence/terrorism' and 'Government effectiveness'. 
        
          <br>
          <br>
          
          Using these two datasets in conjunction with the D3.js library, we hope to produce an information visualisation that can support the project's aim 
          of answering <b>"does the public's perception of the effectiveness of its government 
          correlate with their personal happiness"? Furthermore, through the visualisation can we begin to identify geographical trends between these results?</b>

          <br>
          <br>

          To do this, we started by designing a choropleth map to provide an overview of the happiness and governance data, 
          which compares the Happiness report's 'Life Ladder' attribute with the 'Government Effectiveness' attribute estimate in the WGI dataset. 
          The life ladder attribute is a normalised 1-10 scale where respondents were asked to rate their life from the worst (0) to best possible (10)
           - the average value for each country was recoreded. The 'Government effectiveness' attribute estimates the average citizen's perception of the 
           quality of public services, independence of civil service from political pressures, and government credibility. 
           To visualise this information, we apply a diverging colour scale to each country, mapping the difference between their normalised government 
           effectiveness estimate and the normalised average life ladder value (gov_effect - life_ladder). 
           This produces values within the range [-1,1], where 0 indicates a strong positive correlation between the two data attributes, 
           and -1/1 indicate strong negative relationships; where '1' reflects a strong public perception of government effectiveness but 
           low average life ladder value, and '-1' indicates a low public perception of government effectiveness but high average life ladder value.

          Since both the Happiness report and WGI project collected this data each year, beginning from 2005 and 1996 respectively until 2021,
           we have also provided an animation tool to enable the user to exploring changes in the correlation value over time. 
           To view more data attributes about a country from each dataset, we have linked the choropleth visualisation to a second webpage, 
           which can be accessed by clicking on a country on the map. This secondary page supports a more detailed analysis of the two datasets 
           - for the selected country - using infographics, circular treemaps and a customisable linegraph.
